# Missing Function Error Fix

## Problem
The `SettingsShippingCharges` component was calling `handleCloseShippingModal` function that didn't exist, causing a `ReferenceError: handleCloseShippingModal is not defined`.

## Root Cause
The component had a generic `handleCloseModal` function that takes a modal type as a parameter, but the JSX was calling a specific `handleCloseShippingModal` function that wasn't defined.

## Solution
Added the missing `handleCloseShippingModal` function as a wrapper around the existing `handleCloseModal` function:

```javascript
const handleCloseShippingModal = useCallback(() => {
  handleCloseModal('shippingChargesModal');
}, [handleCloseModal]);
```

## Files Modified
- `final/src/pages/settingsshippingcharges.jsx` - Added missing function

## Result
- The React component now renders without errors
- The close button on the shipping charges modal works properly
- The modal properly clears form data and errors when closed
- Hot module reload automatically updated the running application

## Testing
✅ Component renders without console errors
✅ Modal close button is functional
✅ Form state is properly reset when modal closes
✅ Errors are cleared when modal closes
